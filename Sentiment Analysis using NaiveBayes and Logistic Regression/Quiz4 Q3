Independence:  Looking at the data we can say that each row is independent of other. I could not find any evidence to show that the observations are dependent on one another.

Linearity:

crPlots(murderModel)

From the plot of murderModels, no significant non linear relations was detected. Hence property of linearity is satisfied


Normality:

qqPlot(murderModel, labels=row.names(states), id.method="identify", simulate=TRUE, main=" qqPlot")

From the plot, I can see only one outlier. Rest all the points are within the confidence interval. Hence the Normality condition is satisfied.

Global validation using the gvlma library:

library(gvlma)

gvmodel <- gvlma(murderModel)

summary(gvmodel)

Summary shows that model has a p-value of 0.703 (for Global Stat).

The summary shows that all the assumptions are acceptable.



Error/Noise:

durbinWatsonTest(murderModel)

This shows a non significant p-value of 0.238. Therefore there is no autocorelation and hence there are no errors.


Homoscedasticity:

ncvTest(murderModel)

This gives significant p-value of 0.93. Therefore we can reject the alternate Hypothesis. Hence the error variance is constant which implies homoscedasticity.


Multicolinearity:

sqrt(vif(murderModel))

All the values are less than 2. Therefore there is no multicolinearity.



Outliers:

outlierTest(murderModel)

Massachusetts is the only outlier.



Model Complexity:
Illiteracy and Population are the only significant attributes. So I created a model with only with these two attributes. It was giving a slightly improved value for "Adjusted R-squared"
